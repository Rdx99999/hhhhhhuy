Key Features and Implementation Details
1. Key Disabling
Blocked F12 Key : Prevent users from opening browser developer tools using the F12 key.
Prevent Ctrl+Shift+I (DevTools) : Disable the shortcut for opening developer tools.
Prevent Ctrl+Shift+J (Console) : Block access to the JavaScript console via this shortcut.
Block Ctrl+U (View Source) : Prevent users from viewing the page source code.
Disable Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, Ctrl+X (Copy, Paste, Cut) : Restrict clipboard operations to prevent copying sensitive content.
Block Ctrl+S (Save) : Prevent saving the webpage locally.
Implementation Notes :
Use JavaScript event listeners (keydown, keyup) to intercept and block these key combinations.

2. Right-Click Protection
Completely Disable Context Menu : Prevent users from accessing the right-click context menu, which could expose options like "Inspect Element" or "View Page Source."
Implementation Notes :
Override the contextmenu event and return false to disable the context menu globally.

3. Text Selection Prevention
Disable Text Selection via CSS : Use CSS properties such as user-select: none to prevent text selection.
Prevent Select Events via JavaScript : Intercept and cancel selectstart and mousedown events to block manual text selection.
Block Copy/Cut/Paste Operations : Use JavaScript to override copy, cut, and paste events.
Implementation Notes :
Combine CSS and JavaScript to ensure comprehensive text protection.

4. Console Protection
Override Console Methods : Replace native console methods (log, warn, error, etc.) with custom functions to hide sensitive information.
Add Warning Messages to the Console : Display a warning message when the console is accessed.
Set Up Interval Clearing of Console : Periodically clear the console to prevent users from inspecting logs.
Implementation Notes :
Use setInterval to continuously monitor and clear the console. Ensure warnings are non-intrusive but noticeable.

5. DevTools Detection
Add Size Monitoring : Detect when the browser window is resized, which often indicates the opening of developer tools.
Show Warning Page if DevTools Are Opened : Redirect users to a warning page or display an alert when DevTools are detected.
Implementation Notes :
Monitor the window.outerWidth and outerHeight properties to detect changes in window size.

6. Iframe Protection
Prevent Unauthorized Embedding : Block embedding of your application in unauthorized third-party websites.
Add Domain Whitelist System : Allow embedding only on specific domains by validating the document.referrer property.
Comprehensive Security Measures : Combine iframe protection with other security features to ensure maximum safety.
Implementation Notes :
Use the X-Frame-Options HTTP header or Content-Security-Policy to enforce domain restrictions.

Additional Improvements
7. IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)
Wrap all security functions in an IIFE to encapsulate them and prevent tampering. This ensures that the security logic is isolated and cannot be easily modified by external scripts.
8. Disable Download Button in Player
If your application includes a media player, disable the download button to prevent unauthorized downloading of content.
9. Improved Styling for Full-Screen Appearance
Enhance the UI/UX by ensuring the application looks professional and seamless in full-screen mode.
10. Periodic Console Warnings
Continuously monitor the console and display periodic warnings to discourage misuse.
11. Detection via Window Resizing
Redirect users to a warning page or display an alert if the window size changes, indicating potential DevTools usage.
12. Anti-Iframe Embedding
Ensure your application cannot be embedded in unauthorized iframes by implementing domain whitelisting and other protective measures.
